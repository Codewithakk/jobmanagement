### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MongoDB**
- **NPM**
- **Git**

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jobmanagement.git
   cd jobmanagement
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   Or, for hot-reloading:
   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```
   The backend will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following values:

```bash
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
COMPANY_NAME=your_company_name
EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

These variables are essential for connecting to MongoDB, sending emails, and handling JWT-based authentication.
